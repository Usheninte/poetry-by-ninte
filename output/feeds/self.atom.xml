a hunger did whirl&lt;br&gt;
in my youthful soul&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a week to nineteen&lt;br&gt;
I met with reality&lt;br&gt;
she sang me a song&lt;br&gt;
of digital vitality.&lt;br&gt;
one of wonder, one of strength&lt;br&gt;
and I learnt to sculpt the shadows of the web&lt;br&gt;
I learnt to give form, to thoughts&lt;br&gt;
a blessed gift, indeed that is&lt;br&gt;
for one who was at then&lt;br&gt;
as truly lost as I was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fast forward… twenty-one&lt;br&gt;
in a land of warmth, serene&lt;br&gt;
I know now&lt;br&gt;
even though the road, was in itself&lt;br&gt;
nothing odd, the destination is yet still&lt;br&gt;
so intense that all can do is tutor my mind&lt;br&gt;
walk in awe and nod&lt;br&gt;
as the path grows ever narrow&lt;br&gt;
and I grow ever thirsty&lt;br&gt;
for the precious drops of nectar&lt;br&gt;
that wisdom offers her travellers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to dream should never seem&lt;br&gt;
truly like anything, too foolish to pursue&lt;br&gt;
too stressful to endure&lt;br&gt;
if I have learnt nothing&lt;br&gt;
I have learnt to trust&lt;br&gt;
in the motions of universal winds&lt;br&gt;
for all things&lt;br&gt;
come to those who work&lt;br&gt;
even more so, than those who walk&lt;br&gt;
for in the path itself, is nothing but a way&lt;br&gt;
in the light of night&lt;br&gt;
may I still trek the same&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Self"></category></entry></feed>
