## Origins

I do not know where  
I truly do come from  
my soul does  
beat, and hiss, and hum

my heart  
proves a crooked drum  
I seek no validation

nor look to beg, "please"  
my nation is a country  
that knows not that it is

## Anything

rainbows from the sun  
love that's always born  
a sacred need  
true wonder indeed

anything  
can make you smile  
anything  
from, where I'm from

## Akwaaba

welcome to the land  
of simple dreams  
and wonders kind.

welcome to the home  
of peace, of bliss  
of kings, of queens

## Ride

jungle style  
bust a whine, for a while  
potential stallion  
give you a ride  
for a mile

a riddle, and a fable  
a truth and a lie  
nothing dark or ugly  
I'll give you smiles  
far enough  
to rival, the Nile

## Tropical

the way the wind  
does float, does dance  
and sing  
you would think  
it knows true rhythm

but all it does  
is call, and listen

## Son of the Soil

the man of the moon  
dark and light  
with a soul  
always at noon

he calls the sun  
and runs from none  
he proves the native  
the solemn one
