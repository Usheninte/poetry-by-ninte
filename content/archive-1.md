at seventeen  
all I wanted to do was dream  
and I did, till I fell asleep  
when I woke  
I feared to breathe, to blink  
and then I slept once more  
and in a dream I witnessed  
a vague relevation  
this, triggered a hunt  
for what I knew not  
a hunger did whirl  
in my youthful soul

a week to nineteen  
I met with reality  
she sang me a song  
of digital vitality.  
one of wonder, one of strength  
and I learnt to sculpt the shadows of the web  
I learnt to give form, to thoughts  
a blessed gift, indeed that is  
for one who was at then  
as truly lost as I was

fast forwardâ€¦ twenty-one  
in a land of warmth, serene  
I know now  
even though the road, was in itself  
nothing odd, the destination is yet still  
so intense that all can do is tutor my mind  
walk in awe and nod  
as the path grows ever narrow  
and I grow ever thirsty  
for the precious drops of nectar  
that wisdom offers her travellers

to dream should never seem  
truly like anything, too foolish to pursue  
too stressful to endure  
if I have learnt nothing  
I have learnt to trust  
in the motions of universal winds  
for all things  
come to those who work  
even more so, than those who walk  
for in the path itself, is nothing but a way  
in the light of night  
may I still trek the same
