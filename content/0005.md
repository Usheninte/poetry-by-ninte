I want to say  
a thousand things  
but my mind  
yet still watches  
the dance of your heart

say what you feel  
draw near and breathe deep  
teach me your fantasies  
let me know your faith

and I will conquer a dozen stars  
and take you farther than Mars  
just reach out, speak, smile  
and I will make it worth your while
