The Journey  
Once upon a time  
A little while ago  
My younger self  
Hopped on a jet  
To learn to scale technology.

I left the land  
I knew as home  
All for faith,  
To grow some more  
To rise & soar.

The journey has begun  
For a life of Entrepreneurship  
Never truly ends.  
Blessed with momentum infinite  
I have newfound family.
