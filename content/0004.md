we dance away from  
stronger roots, than  
branches stretched from  
the mind's roof.

for sake of pain, for  
same again, and stumble  
sharp, with crooked hooves.  
when we could stand

indeed we do, we wake up strong  
from dreams untrue.  
with hope quite calm  
and vigor renewed,

to do the things  
we feared to do.
